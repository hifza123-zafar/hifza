<h1>ABOUT TIGER</h1>
The magnificent tiger, Panthera tigris is a striped animal. It has a thick yellow coat of fur with dark stripes. The combination of grace, strength, agility and enormous power has earned the tiger its pride of place as the national animal of India. Out of eight races of the species known, the Indian race, the Royal Bengal Tiger, is found throughout the country except in the north-western region and also in the neighbouring countries, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. To check the dwindling population of tigers in India, 'Project Tiger' was launched in April 1973. So far, 27 tiger reserves have been established in the country under this project, covering an area of 37,761 sq km. <br><br>

The tiger is found in various parts of the Indian Subcontinent including India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. In India, it is found in most parts of the country except the north-eastern regions. They are found in the jungles of West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Odisha. India now is home to 70% of the worldâ€™s tiger population. As of 2016 a total number of 2500 adult or sub-adult tigers of 1.5 years or more are present in the various tiger reserves across India. Bandipur National Park in Karnataka has the highest number of Royal Bengal Tigers at 408 closely followed by Uttarakhand with340 tigers and Madhya Pradesh with 308.

<h1>Behavior</h1>
By nature Royal Bengal tigers are solitary and generally do not form packs. They are territorial and the size of their territories depends on the abundance of prey. They generally mark their territories with urine, anal gland secretions and claw marks. The females of the species are generally accompanied by her cubs until they attain adulthood. Royal Bengal Tigers are nocturnal animals. They laze around during the day and hunt during the night. They are excellent swimmers and climb trees with much ease despite their large bodies. 

Royal Bengal Tigers are carnivores and they prey mainly on medium sized herbivores such as chital deer, sambars, nilgais, buffalos and gaurs. They also prey on smaller animals such as rabbits or monkeys. They have also been reported to prey on young elephant and rhino calves. 

These tigers use stealth to track their prey, wait till they are close to them and they pounce while aiming to overpower either by severing the spinal cord or by biting the jugular vein in the throat of the prey. The Royal Bengal tigers can eat upto 30 Kg of meat at a time and can survive for three weeks without food.
